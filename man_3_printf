					Programmers manual of the function printf()


Description

The printf() function places output on the standard output stream stdout.


Conversion Specifications

Each conversion specification is introduced by the % character or by the character sequence %n$, after which the following appear in sequence:
An optional field, consisting of a decimal digit string followed by a $, specifying the next argument to be converted. If this field is not provided, the args following the last argument converted will be used.


Flag Characters
The flag characters and their meanings are:

The integer portion of the result of a decimal conversion (%i, %d, %u, %f, %F, %g, or %G) will be formatted with thousands' grouping characters. 
For other conversions the behavior is undefined. The non-monetary grouping character is used.


Example
